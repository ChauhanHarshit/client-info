# HYBRID BACKUP SYSTEM SETUP

**Status**: Secondary Supabase backup layer being configured
**Date**: January 13, 2025

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Primary Backup System (ACTIVE)
- **Type**: Local cron/script-based backups
- **Location**: `./backups/` directory
- **Retention**: 30 days
- **Features**:
  - ✅ Pre-change backup workflows
  - ✅ Manual backup descriptions
  - ✅ Local .sql file visibility
  - ✅ Custom retention logic

### Secondary Backup System (CONFIGURING)
- **Type**: Supabase managed backups
- **Location**: Supabase cloud infrastructure
- **Retention**: 35 days (maximum)
- **Features**:
  - ⏳ Point-in-time recovery (to be enabled)
  - ⏳ Automated scheduling (to be configured)
  - ⏳ Geographic distribution
  - ⏳ Enterprise-grade reliability

## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Configure Supabase Managed Backups

Run the configuration script:
```bash
npm run backup:supabase-config
```

### Step 2: Manual Supabase Dashboard Setup

1. **Navigate to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to your project settings
   - Select "Database" > "Backups"

2. **Enable Automatic Backups**
   - Toggle "Enable automatic backups" (requires Pro plan)
   - Set retention period to 35 days (maximum)
   - Configure frequency: Every 6 hours (recommended)

3. **Enable Point-in-Time Recovery**
   - Toggle "Enable point-in-time recovery"
   - This allows restoration to any specific timestamp

### Step 3: Verify Hybrid System

Check both systems are working:
```bash
npm run backup:hybrid-monitor
```

Generate detailed status report:
```bash
npm run backup:hybrid-report
```

## MONITORING COMMANDS

### Daily Monitoring
```bash
# Full system check
npm run backup:hybrid-monitor

# Check synchronization status
npm run backup:sync-check

# Supabase-specific status
npm run backup:supabase-status
```

### Manual Backup Operations
```bash
# Create manual local backup
npm run backup:manual

# Create pre-change backup
npm run backup:pre-change "Description of upcoming change"

# List all local backups
npm run backup:list
```

## BACKUP SYSTEM WORKFLOW

### For Regular Operations
1. **Local system** continues daily automated backups
2. **Supabase system** runs every 6 hours automatically
3. **Monitor script** checks both systems daily

### For Database Changes
1. **Pre-change backup** created locally with description
2. Changes made with approval protocol
3. Both systems continue parallel operation

## TESTING SCHEDULE

### Week 1-2: Parallel Operation
- Both systems running simultaneously
- Monitor for any conflicts or issues
- Verify Supabase backups are being created

### Week 3: Restore Testing
- Test local backup restoration
- Test Supabase point-in-time recovery
- Document restore procedures

### Week 4: System Evaluation
- Compare reliability and performance
- Decide on long-term configuration
- Consider consolidation options

## PROTECTION FEATURES

### Current Protections (Active)
- ✅ Pre-change backups mandatory
- ✅ 30-day local retention
- ✅ Manual backup descriptions
- ✅ Written approval protocols

### Added Protections (Configuring)
- ⏳ Point-in-time recovery
- ⏳ Geographic backup distribution
- ⏳ Enterprise-grade backup infrastructure
- ⏳ Extended 35-day retention

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Complete Supabase Configuration** (requires manual dashboard setup)
2. **Run initial hybrid monitoring** to verify both systems
3. **Schedule testing** of restore procedures
4. **Monitor for 2-4 weeks** before considering consolidation

## EMERGENCY CONTACTS

- **Local Backup Issues**: Check `./backups/backup.log`
- **Supabase Issues**: Check `./backups/supabase-backup.log`
- **Hybrid Monitoring**: Check `./backups/hybrid-monitor.log`

**Both systems maintain your existing backup protection protocols while adding enterprise-grade reliability.**
