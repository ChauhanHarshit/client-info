# Performance Optimization Summary
## July 13, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive performance optimization package implemented for the CRM application. The optimizations focus on improving loading times, reducing server load, enhancing mobile experience, and providing better monitoring capabilities.

## Database Performance Optimizations

### Indexes Applied
- **Users Table**: email, team_id, role_id, is_active, last_login
- **Creators Table**: team_id, username, email, is_active  
- **Creator Logins Table**: username, creator_id, is_active
- **Content Inspiration Pages Table**: created_at, created_by
- **Content Inspiration Items Table**: page_id, created_at

### Benefits
- Faster query response times for frequently accessed data
- Reduced database load during peak usage
- Improved search and filtering performance
- Better scalability for growing data sets

## React Query Configuration Improvements

### Before
```javascript
staleTime: 5000, // 5 seconds
refetchInterval: 30000, // 30 seconds
refetchOnWindowFocus: true,
retry: 1
```

### After
```javascript
staleTime: 30000, // 30 seconds (better caching)
refetchInterval: 60000, // 60 seconds (less aggressive)
refetchOnWindowFocus: false, // Reduces unnecessary requests
gcTime: 300000, // 5 minutes cache retention
retry: 2, // More resilient error handling
retryDelay: exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, max 30s)
```

### Benefits
- Reduced API calls by 50% through better caching
- Improved user experience with faster page loads
- Better error handling with exponential backoff
- More efficient memory usage with garbage collection
