## üìä PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

### Bundle Size Analysis
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è BUILD TIMEOUT OBSERVED
- Build process shows high complexity (300+ transformations)
- Large dependency tree (Framer Motion, TanStack Query, etc.)
- Build timeout suggests optimization needed

### Database Performance
**Status**: ‚úÖ OPTIMIZED
- Connection pool configured for serverless (max: 10, min: 0)
- Query timeouts set to 5 seconds
- Connection timeout management implemented

### Caching Strategy
**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- React Query with optimized staleTime/gcTime
- Cache invalidation on mutations
- Session-based caching for authentication

---

## üö® IDENTIFIED POTENTIAL ISSUES

### 1. Build Performance
**Issue**: Build process times out after 30+ seconds
**Impact**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM - May cause deployment delays
**Solution**: Consider code splitting or dependency optimization

### 2. Authentication Flow
**Issue**: Hybrid authentication requires careful routing
**Impact**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM - Deployment routing must be precise
**Verification**: Needs live testing with deployed environment

### 3. File Upload Limits
**Issue**: 500MB file size limit may affect deployment platform
**Impact**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM - Platform-specific limitations
**Verification**: Needs testing on actual deployment platform

### 4. Profile Picture File References
**Issue**: Some profile picture files may not exist in uploads directory
**Impact**: ‚ö†Ô∏è LOW - CreatorAvatar component has proper fallback handling
**Verification**: Fallback system will handle missing files gracefully
