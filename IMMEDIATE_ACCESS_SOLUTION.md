## DNS Issue Diagnosis

Your DNS change to 34.111.179.208 is correct, but may take longer to propagate due to:
1. Local DNS cache on your device
2. ISP DNS cache
3. Browser DNS cache

## Force DNS Refresh Options

**Option 1: Flush local DNS cache**
- Windows: Open cmd as admin → `ipconfig /flushdns`
- Mac: `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache`
- Chrome: Go to chrome://net-internals/#dns → Clear host cache

**Option 2: Use different DNS servers temporarily**
- Change your DNS to: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 (Google DNS)
- Or use: 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 (Cloudflare DNS)

**Option 3: Test from different device/network**
- Try accessing tastyyyy.com/mass-calendar-log from your phone (using mobile data)
- This bypasses your local network's DNS cache

## Timeline Expectation
- DNS changes can take 30 minutes to 24 hours
- Most changes propagate within 2-4 hours
- The direct Replit links work immediately
